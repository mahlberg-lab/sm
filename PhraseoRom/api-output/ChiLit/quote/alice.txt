and what is the use of a book
without pictures or
conversations
Oh dear!
Oh dear! I shall be late
Well
after such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at
home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top
of the house
I wonder how
many miles I've fallen by this time
I must be getting
somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
thousand miles down, I think
yes, that's about the right distance -- but then I wonder what Latitude
or Longitude I've got to
I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the
earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with
their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think
but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country
is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia
And what an
ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to
ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere
Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think
I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no
mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very
like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder
Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats
Do
bats eat cats
Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:
did you ever eat a bat
Oh my ears
and whiskers, how late it's getting
and even if my head would go through
it
would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could
shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin
which certainly was not here
before
Drink me
No, I'll look first
and
see whether it's marked "poison" or not
poison
poison
What a curious feeling
I must be shutting up like a
telescope
for it might end, you know
in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
what I should be like then
Come, there's no use in crying like that
I advise you to leave off this minute
But it's no use now
to pretend to be two people!
Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person
Well, I'll eat it
and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll
get into the garden, and I don't care which happens
Which way? Which
way
Curiouser and curiouser
now I'm
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet
Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder
who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure
_I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;-- but I must be
kind to them
or perhaps they won't walk the way I want
to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas
They must
go by the carrier
You ought to be ashamed of yourself
a great girl like
you
to go on crying in this way! Stop this
moment, I tell you
Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!
Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting
If you please, sir
Dear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a
little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who
in the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle
I'm sure I'm not Ada
for her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and -- oh dear, how puzzling
it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me
see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and
four times seven is -- oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!
However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.
London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and
Rome -- no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for
Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little
How doth the little crocodile
      Improve his shining tail,
     And pour the waters of the Nile
      On every golden scale!

     'How cheerfully he seems to grin,
      How neatly spread his claws,
     And welcome little fishes in
      With gently smiling jaws
I'm sure those are not the right words
I must be Mabel after all, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've
made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no
use their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I
shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then,
if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here
till I'm somebody else"-- but, oh dear
I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired
of being all alone here
How CAN I have done that
I must
be growing small again
That WAS a narrow escape
and
now for the garden
and things are worse than ever
for I never was so small as this before, never!
And I declare it's too bad, that it is
and in that case I can go back by
railway
I wish I hadn't cried so much
I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!
However, everything is queer to-day
Would it be of any use, now
to speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying
O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse
A mouse -- of
a mouse -- to a mouse -- a mouse -- O mouse
Perhaps it doesn't understand English
I daresay it's
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror
Ou est ma chatte
Oh, I beg your pardon
I quite forgot you didn't like cats
Not like cats
Would
YOU like cats if you were me
Well, perhaps not
don't be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet
thing
and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and
washing her face -- and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse -- and she's
such a capital one for catching mice -- oh, I beg your pardon
We won't talk about her any
more if you'd rather not
We indeed
As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED
cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again
I won't indeed
Are you -- are you fond -- of -- of dogs
There is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when
you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of things -- I can't remember half of them -- and it belongs to a farmer,
you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He
says it kills all the rats and -- oh dear
I'm afraid I've offended it again
Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them
Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs
I am older than
you, and must know better
Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you
dry enough
Ahem
are you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! "William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria
Ugh
I beg your pardon
Did
you speak
Not I
I thought you did
I proceed. "Edwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,
the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable
Found WHAT
Found IT
of course you know what
"it" means
I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing
it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
archbishop find
found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his
Normans --" How are you getting on now, my dear
As wet as ever
it doesn't seem to
dry me at all
In that case
I move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies
Speak English
I don't know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either
What I was going to say
was, that
the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race
What IS a Caucus-race
Why
the best way to explain it is to do it
the exact
shape doesn't matter
One, two, three, and
away
The race is over
But who has won
EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes
But who is to give the prizes
Why, SHE, of course
Prizes! Prizes
But she must have a prize herself, you know
Of course
What else have you got in
your pocket
Only a thimble
Hand it over here
We beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble
You promised to tell me your history, you know
and why
it is you hate -- C and D
Mine is a long and a sad tale
It IS a long tail, certainly
but why do you call it sad
Fury said to a
         mouse, That he
        met in the
       house,
     "Let us
      both go to
       law: I will
        prosecute
         YOU.-- Come,
           I'll take no
           denial; We
          must have a
        trial: For
      really this
     morning I've
    nothing
    to do."
      Said the
      mouse to the
       cur, "Such
        a trial,
         dear Sir,
            With
          no jury
        or judge,
       would be
      wasting
      our
      breath."
        "I'll be
        judge, I'll
         be jury,"
             Said
         cunning
          old Fury:
          "I'll
          try the
            whole
            cause,
              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           death
You are not attending
What are you
thinking of
I beg your pardon
you had got to the fifth
bend, I think
I had NOT
A knot
Oh, do let me help to undo it
I shall do nothing of the sort
You insult me by talking such nonsense
I didn't mean it
But you're so easily offended,
you know
Please come back and finish your story
Yes, please do
What a pity it wouldn't stay
Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
YOUR temper
Hold your tongue, Ma
You're enough to try the patience of an oyster
I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do
She'd soon fetch it back
And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question
Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice you
can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it
I really must be getting home; the night-air
doesn't suit my throat
Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed
I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah
Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more
The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder
Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing
out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!
Quick, now
He took me for his housemaid
How
surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him
his fan and gloves -- that is, if I can find them
How queer it seems
to be going messages for
a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next
Miss Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a minute,
nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't
think
that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it
began ordering people about like that
DRINK ME
I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen
whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what
this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really
I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing
That's quite enough -- I hope I shan't
grow any more -- As it is, I can't get out at the door -- I do wish I hadn't
drunk quite so much
Now I
can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me
It was much pleasanter at home
when one wasn't
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole -- and yet -- and
yet -- it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that
kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!
There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I
grow up, I'll write one -- but I'm grown up now
at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE
But then
shall I NEVER get any older than I am
now? That'll be a comfort, one way -- never to be an old woman -- but
then -- always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT
Oh, you foolish Alice
How can you learn
lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all
for any lesson-books
Mary Ann! Mary Ann
Fetch me my gloves this moment
Then I'll
go round and get in at the window
Pat! Pat! Where are you
Sure then I'm here! Digging
for apples, yer honour
Digging for apples, indeed
Here! Come and
help me out of THIS
Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window
Sure, it's an arm, yer honour
arrum
An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window
Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that
Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away
Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at
all
Do as I tell you, you coward
What a number of
cucumber-frames there must be
I wonder what they'll do
next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm
sure I don't want to stay in here any longer
Where's the other
ladder?-- Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other -- Bill!
fetch it here, lad!-- Here, put 'em up at this corner -- No, tie 'em
together first -- they don't reach half high enough yet -- Oh! they'll
do well enough; don't be particular -- Here, Bill! catch hold of this
rope -- Will the roof bear?-- Mind that loose slate -- Oh, it's coming
down! Heads below
Now, who did that?-- It was Bill, I
fancy -- Who's to go down the chimney?-- Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!-- That I
won't, then!-- Bill's to go down -- Here, Bill! the master says you're to
go down the chimney
Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he
Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in
Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
I THINK I can kick a little
This is Bill
There goes Bill
Catch him, you by the hedge
Hold up his head -- Brandy
now -- Don't choke him -- How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it
That's Bill
Well, I hardly know -- No more, thank ye; I'm better now -- but I'm
a deal too flustered to tell you -- all I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket
So you did, old fellow
We must burn the house down
If you do. I'll set Dinah at you
I
wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the
roof off
A barrowful will do, to begin with
A barrowful of WHAT
I'll put a stop to this
You'd better not do that again
If I eat one of these cakes
it's sure to make
SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must
make me smaller, I suppose
The first thing I've got to do
is to grow to my right size again; and the second
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be
the best plan
Poor little thing
And yet what a dear little puppy it was
I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if -- if I'd
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that
I've got to grow up again! Let me see -- how IS it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what
Who are YOU
I -- I hardly know, sir, just at present -- at least I know
who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then
What do you mean by that
Explain
yourself
I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir
because I'm not
myself, you see
I don't see
I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly
for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing
It isn't
Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet
but when you
have to turn into a chrysalis -- you will some day, you know -- and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little
queer, won't you
Not a bit
Well, perhaps your feelings may be different
all I know
is, it would feel very queer to ME
You
Who are YOU
I think,
you ought to tell me who YOU are, first
Why
Come back
I've something important
to say
Keep your temper
Is that all
No
So you think
you're changed, do you
I'm afraid I am, sir
I can't remember things as I
used -- and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together
Can't remember WHAT things
Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it all came
different
Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM
You are old, Father William
And your hair has become very white;
   And yet you incessantly stand on your head --
    Do you think, at your age, it is right
In my youth
I feared it might injure the brain;
   But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again
You are old
as I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
   Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door --
    Pray, what is the reason of that
In my youth
I kept all my limbs very supple
   By the use of this ointment -- one shilling the box --
    Allow me to sell you a couple
You are old
and your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
   Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak --
    Pray how did you manage to do it
In my youth
I took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
   And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life
You are old
one would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
   Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose --
    What made you so awfully clever
I have answered three questions, and that is enough
don't give yourself airs!
   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs
That is not said right
Not QUITE right, I'm afraid
some of the words
have got altered
It is wrong from beginning to end
What size do you want to be
Oh, I'm not particular as to size
only one
doesn't like changing so often, you know
I DON'T know
Are you content now
Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind
three inches is such a wretched height to be
It is a very good height indeed
But I'm not used to it
I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
offended
You'll get used to it in time
One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter
One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT
Of the mushroom
And now which is which
Come, my head's free at last
What CAN all that green stuff be
And where HAVE my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you
Serpent
I'm NOT a serpent
Let me alone
Serpent, I say again
I've tried every way, and nothing seems
to suit them
I haven't the least idea what you're talking about
I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
hedges
but those
serpents! There's no pleasing them
As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs
but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks
I'm very sorry you've been annoyed
And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood
and just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from
the sky! Ugh, Serpent
But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you
I'm a -- I'm a
Well! WHAT are you
I can see you're trying to
invent something
I -- I'm a little girl
A likely story indeed
I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE
with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use
denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an
egg
I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly
but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know
I don't believe it
but if they do, why then they're
a kind of serpent, that's all I can say
You're
looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me
whether you're a little girl or a serpent
It matters a good deal to ME
but I'm not looking
for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't
like them raw
Well, be off, then
Come, there's half my plan done
now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going
to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right
size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden -- how IS that
to be done, I wonder
Whoever lives
there
it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,
I should frighten them out of their wits
For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen
to play croquet
From the Queen. An
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet
There's no sort of use in knocking
and that for
two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you
are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you
Please, then
how am I to get in
There might be some sense in your knocking
if we had the door between us. For instance,
if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know
But perhaps he can't help it
his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.
But at any rate he might answer questions.-- How am I to get in
I shall sit here
till tomorrow
or next day, maybe
How am I to get in
ARE you to get in at all
That's the first
question, you know
It's really
dreadful
the way all the creatures argue.
It's enough to drive one crazy
I shall sit here
on and off, for
days and days
But what am I to do
Anything you like
Oh, there's no use in talking to him
he's
perfectly idiotic
There's certainly too much pepper in that soup
Please would you tell me
why
your cat grins like that
It's a Cheshire cat
and that's why. Pig
I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know
that cats COULD grin
They all can
and most of 'em do
I don't know of any that do
You don't know much
and that's a fact
Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing
Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose
If everybody minded their own business
the world would go round a deal faster than it does
Which would NOT be an advantage
Just think of
what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes
twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis
Talking of axes
chop off her head
Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is
it twelve? I
Oh, don't bother ME
I never could abide figures
Speak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
   He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases
Wow! wow! wow
I speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
   For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases
Wow! wow! wow
Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like
I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen
just
like a star-fish
IF I don't take this child away with me
they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be
murder to leave it behind
Don't grunt
that's not at all a proper way of expressing
yourself
But perhaps it was only sobbing
If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear
I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now
Now, what am I to do with
this creature when I get it home
If it had grown up
it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think
if one only knew the right way to change them
Cheshire Puss
Come, it's pleased so far
Would you
tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here
That depends a good deal on where you want to get to
I don't much care where
Then it doesn't matter which way you go
so long as I get SOMEWHERE
Oh, you're sure to do that
if you only walk long
enough
What sort of people live about here
In THAT direction
lives
a Hatter: and in THAT direction
lives a March
Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad
But I don't want to go among mad people
Oh, you can't help that
we're all mad here. I'm mad.
You're mad
How do you know I'm mad
You must be
or you wouldn't have come here
And how
do you know that you're mad
To begin with
a dog's not mad. You grant that
I suppose so
Well, then
you see, a dog growls when it's angry,
and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and
wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad
I call it purring, not growling
Call it what you like
Do you play croquet with the
Queen to-day
I should like it very much
but I haven't been invited
yet
You'll see me there
By-the-bye, what became of the baby
I'd nearly
forgotten to ask
It turned into a pig
I thought it would
I've seen hatters before
the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad -- at least not so mad as
it was in March
Did you say pig, or fig
I said pig
and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and
vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy
All right
Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin
but a grin
without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life
Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost
wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead
Very
uncomfortable for the Dormouse
only, as it's asleep, I
suppose it doesn't mind
No room! No room
There's PLENTY of room
Have some wine
I don't see any wine
There isn't any
Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it
It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited
I didn't know it was YOUR table
it's laid for a great
many more than three
Your hair wants cutting
You should learn not to make personal remarks
it's very rude
Why is a raven like a writing-desk
Come, we shall have some fun now
I'm glad they've
begun asking riddles.-- I believe I can guess that
Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it
Exactly so
Then you should say what you mean
I do
at least -- at least I mean what I
say -- that's the same thing, you know
Not the same thing a bit
You might just as well say
that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see
You might just as well say
that "I like what I
get" is the same thing as "I get what I like
You might just as well say
that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing
as "I sleep when I breathe
It IS the same thing with you
What day of the month
is it
The fourth
Two days wrong
I told you butter wouldn't suit
the works
It was the BEST butter
Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well
you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife
It was the BEST butter,
you know
What a
funny watch
It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
tell what o'clock it is
Why should it
Does YOUR watch tell you what
year it is
Of course not
but that's because it
stays the same year for such a long time together
Which is just the case with MINE
I don't quite
understand you
The Dormouse is asleep again
Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself
Have you guessed the riddle yet
No, I give it up
what's the answer
I haven't the slightest idea
Nor I
I think you might do something better with the
time
than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers
If you knew Time as well as I do
you wouldn't talk
about wasting IT. It's HIM
I don't know what you mean
Of course you don't
I dare say you never even spoke to Time
Perhaps not
but I know I have to beat time
when I learn music
Ah! that accounts for it
He won't stand beating.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything
you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
time for dinner
I only wish it was
That would be grand, certainly
but then -- I
shouldn't be hungry for it, you know
Not at first, perhaps
but you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked
Is that the way YOU manage
Not I
We
quarrelled last March -- just before HE went mad, you know
I've heard something like it
It goes on, you know
in this way:--

     "Up above the world you fly,
     Like a tea-tray in the sky.
         Twinkle, twinkle
Twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse
when the
Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the time! Off with his
head
How dreadfully savage
And ever since that
he won't
do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now
Is that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here
Yes, that's it
it's always tea-time,
and we've no time to wash the things between whiles
Then you keep moving round, I suppose
Exactly so
as the things get used up
But what happens when you come to the beginning again
Suppose we change the subject
I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story
I'm afraid I don't know one
Then the Dormouse shall
Wake up, Dormouse
I wasn't asleep
I heard every word you fellows were saying
Tell us a story
Yes, please do
And be quick about it
or you'll be asleep again
before it's done
Once upon a time there were three little sisters
and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a well
What did they live on
They lived on treacle
They couldn't have done that, you know
they'd
have been ill
So they were
VERY ill
But
why did they live at the bottom of a well
Take some more tea
I've had nothing yet
so I can't
take more
You mean you can't take LESS
it's very easy to take
MORE than nothing
Nobody asked YOUR opinion
Who's making personal remarks now
Why did they live at the bottom of a well
It was a treacle-well
There's no such thing
Sh! sh
If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for
yourself
No, please go on
I won't interrupt again. I
dare say there may be ONE
One, indeed
And so these three little sisters -- they were learning to draw,
you know
What did they draw
Treacle
I want a clean cup
let's all move one place
on
But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle
from
You can draw water out of a water-well
so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well -- eh, stupid
But they were IN the well
well in
They were learning to draw
and they drew all manner of
things -- everything that begins with an M
Why with an M
Why not
that begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness -- you know you say
things are "much of a muchness"-- did you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness
Really, now you ask me
I don't
think
Then you shouldn't talk
At any rate I'll never go THERE again
It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all
my life
That's very curious
But
everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once
Now, I'll manage better this time
Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like
that
I couldn't help it
Seven jogged my
elbow
That's right, Five! Always lay the
blame on others
YOU'D better not talk
I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded
What for
That's none of YOUR business, Two
Yes, it IS his business
and I'll tell him -- it was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions
Well, of all the unjust
things
Would you tell me
why you are painting
those roses
Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.
So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to
The Queen! The Queen
and besides, what would be the use of
a procession
if people had all to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldn't see it
Who is this
Idiot
What's your name, child
My name is Alice, so please your Majesty
Why, they're only a pack of cards, after
all. I needn't be afraid of them
And who are THESE
How should I know
It's no
business of MINE
Off with her head! Off
Nonsense
Consider, my
dear: she is only a child
Turn them
over
Get up
Leave off that
You make me giddy
What HAVE you been doing here
May it please your Majesty
we were trying
I see
Off with their heads
You shan't be beheaded
Are their heads off
Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty
That's right
Can you play croquet
Yes
Come on, then
It's -- it's a very fine day
Very
where's the Duchess
Hush! Hush
She's under
sentence of execution
What for
Did you say "What a pity
No, I didn't
I don't think it's at all a pity. I said
"What for
She boxed the Queen's ears
Oh, hush
The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
Queen said
Get to your places
Off with his head
Off with her head
and then
what would become of me? They're dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one
left alive
It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to
How are you getting on
It's no use
speaking to it
till its ears have come, or at least one
of them
I don't think they play at all fairly
and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear
oneself speak -- and they don't seem to have any rules in particular;
at least, if there are, nobody attends to them -- and you've no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the
arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
ground -- and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming
How do you like the Queen
Not at all
she's so extremely
likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game
Who ARE you talking to
It's a friend of mine -- a Cheshire Cat
allow me to
introduce it
I don't like the look of it at all
however, it may
kiss my hand if it likes
I'd rather not
Don't be impertinent
and don't look at me like that
A cat may look at a king
I've read that in some book,
but I don't remember where
Well, it must be removed
My dear! I wish you would
have this cat removed
Off with his head
I'll fetch the executioner myself
but it doesn't
matter much
as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground
It belongs to the Duchess:
you'd better ask HER about it
She's in prison
fetch her here
You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing
When I'M a Duchess
I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very
well without -- Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered
and vinegar that makes them sour -- and camomile that makes
them bitter -- and -- and barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so
stingy about it, you know
You're thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit
Perhaps it hasn't one
Tut, tut, child
Everything's got a moral, if only
you can find it
The game's going on rather better now
'Tis so
tis love, that makes the world go round
Somebody said
that it's done by everybody minding
their own business
Ah, well! It means much the same thing
and the moral
of THAT is --"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves
How fond she is of finding morals in things
I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist
the reason is, that I'm doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment
HE might bite
Very true
flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that is --"Birds of a feather flock together
Only mustard isn't a bird
Right, as usual
what a clear way you have of
putting things
It's a mineral, I THINK
Of course it is
there's a large mustard-mine near here. And
the moral of that is --"The more there is of mine, the less there is of
yours
Oh, I know
it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is
I quite agree with you
and the moral of that
is --"Be what you would seem to be"-- or if you'd like it put more
simply --"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise
than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise
I think I should understand that better
if
I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it
That's nothing to what I could say if I chose
Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that
Oh, don't talk about trouble
I make you a present
of everything I've said as yet
A cheap sort of present
I'm glad they don't give
birthday presents like that
Thinking again
I've a right to think
Just about as much right
as pigs have to fly; and
the m
moral
A fine day, your Majesty
Now, I give you fair warning
either you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time! Take your choice
Let's go on with the game
Off with his head
Off with her
head
Have
you seen the Mock Turtle yet
No
I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is
It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from
I never saw one, or heard of one
Come on, then
and he shall tell you his history
You are all pardoned
Come, THAT'S a good
thing
Up, lazy
thing
and take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered
What fun
What IS the fun
Why, SHE
It's all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on
Everybody says "come on!" here
I never was so ordered about in all my life, never
What is his sorrow
It's all his
fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on
This here young lady
she wants for to know your
history, she do
I'll tell it her
sit
down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished
I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin
Once
I was a real
Turtle
Hjckrrh
Thank you, sir, for your interesting story
When we were little
we went to school in the
sea. The master was an old Turtle -- we used to call him Tortoise
Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one
We called him Tortoise because he taught us
really you are very dull
You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question
Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it
Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it
I never said I didn't
You did
Hold your tongue
We had the best of educations -- in fact, we went to school every day
I'VE been to a day-school, too
you needn't be so proud
as all that
With extras
Yes
we learned French and music
And washing
Certainly not
Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school
Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,
"French, music, AND WASHING -- extra
You couldn't have wanted it much
living at the bottom of
the sea
I couldn't afford to learn it
I
only took the regular course
What was that
Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with
and then the different branches of Arithmetic -- Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision
I never heard of "Uglification
What is it
What! Never heard of
uglifying
You know what to beautify is, I suppose
Yes
it means -- to -- make -- anything -- prettier
Well, then
if you don't know what to uglify is,
you ARE a simpleton
What else had you to learn
Well, there was Mystery
Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling -- the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils
What was THAT like
Well, I can't show it you myself
I'm too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it
Hadn't time
I went to the Classics master, though.
He was an old crab, HE was
I never went to him
he taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say
So he did, so he did
And how many hours a day did you do lessons
Ten hours the first day
nine the next, and so
on
What a curious plan
That's the reason they're called lessons
because they lessen from day to day
Then the eleventh day must have been a
holiday
Of course it was
And how did you manage on the twelfth
That's enough about lessons
tell her something about the games now
Same as if he had a bone in his throat
You may not have lived much under the sea
I haven't
and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster
I once tasted
so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is
No, indeed
What sort of a dance is it
Why
you first form into a line along the
sea-shore
Two lines
Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way
THAT generally takes some time
you advance twice
Each with a lobster as a partner
Of course
advance twice, set to partners
change lobsters, and retire in same order
Then, you know
you throw the
The lobsters
as far out to sea as you can
Swim after them
Turn a somersault in the sea
Change lobsters again
Back to land again, and that's all the first figure
It must be a very pretty dance
Would you like to see a little of it
Very much indeed
Come, let's try the first figure
We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing
Oh, YOU sing
I've forgotten the words
You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
 When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea
Too far, too far
Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch
and I do so like that curious song
about the whiting
Oh, as to the whiting
they -- you've seen them,
of course
Yes
I've often seen them at dinn
I don't know where Dinn may be
but if you've
seen them so often, of course you know what they're like
I believe so
They have their tails in
their mouths -- and they're all over crumbs
You're wrong about the crumbs
crumbs would all
wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the
reason is
Tell her
about the reason and all that
The reason is
that they WOULD go with the lobsters
to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long
way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get
them out again. That's all
Thank you
it's very interesting. I never knew so much
about a whiting before
I can tell you more than that, if you like
Do you
know why it's called a whiting
I never thought about it
Why
IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES
Does the boots and shoes
Why, what are YOUR shoes done with
I mean, what
makes them so shiny
They're done with blacking, I believe
Boots and shoes under the sea
are done with a whiting. Now you know
And what are they made of
Soles and eels, of course
any shrimp could have told you that
If I'd been the whiting
I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep back, please: we
don't want YOU with us
They were obliged to have him with them
no
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise
Wouldn't it really
Of course not
why, if a fish came to ME, and
told me he was going a journey, I should say "With what porpoise
Don't you mean "purpose
I mean what I say
Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures
I could tell you my adventures -- beginning from this morning
but it's no use going back to yesterday,
because I was a different person then
Explain all that
No, no! The adventures first
explanations take such a dreadful time
YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM
That's very curious
It's all about as curious as it can be
It all came different
I
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin
TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD
How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons
I might as well be at school at once
'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
  "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
   As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes
That's different from what I used to say when I was a child
Well, I never heard it before
but it sounds
uncommon nonsense
I should like to have it explained
She can't explain it
Go on with the next
verse
But about his toes
How COULD he turn them
out with his nose, you know
It's the first position in dancing
Go on with the next verse
it
begins "I passed by his garden
I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie
What IS the use of repeating all that stuff
if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most
confusing thing I ever heard
Yes, I think you'd better leave off
Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille
Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song
Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind
Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, old
fellow
Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
   Waiting in a hot tureen!
   Who for such dainties would not stoop?
   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
     Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop!
     Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop!
   Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening,
     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

   'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
   Game, or any other dish?
   Who would not give all else for two
   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
     Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop!
     Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop!
   Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening,
     Beautiful, beauti -- FUL SOUP
Chorus again
The trial's beginning
Come on
What trial is it
Come on
Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening,
     Beautiful, beautiful Soup
I wish they'd get the
trial done
and hand round the refreshments
That's the judge
because of his great wig
And that's the jury-box
and those twelve creatures
creatures
I suppose they are the jurors
jury-men
What are they
doing
They can't have anything to put
down yet, before the trial's begun
They're putting down their names
for
fear they should forget them before the end of the trial
Stupid things
Silence in the court
stupid things
stupid
A nice
muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over
Herald, read the accusation
The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
      All on a summer day:
    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
      And took them quite away
Consider your verdict
Not yet, not yet
There's a great
deal to come before that
Call the first witness
First witness
I beg pardon, your
Majesty
for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished
my tea when I was sent for
You ought to have finished
When did you begin
Fourteenth of March, I think it
was
Fifteenth
Sixteenth
Write that down
Take off your hat
It isn't mine
Stolen
I keep them to sell
I've none of
my own. I'm a hatter
Give your evidence
and don't be nervous, or I'll have
you executed on the spot
I wish you wouldn't squeeze so
I can hardly breathe
I can't help it
I'm growing
You've no right to grow here
Don't talk nonsense
you know you're growing
too
Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace
not in that
ridiculous fashion
Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert
Give your evidence
or I'll have you
executed, whether you're nervous or not
I'm a poor man, your Majesty
and I hadn't begun my tea -- not above a week or so -- and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin -- and the twinkling of the tea
The twinkling of the what
It began with the tea
Of course twinkling begins with a T
Do you
take me for a dunce? Go on
I'm a poor man
and most things twinkled after
that -- only the March Hare said
I didn't
You did
I deny it
He denies it
leave out that part
Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said
After that
I cut some more bread-and-butter
But what did the Dormouse say
That I can't remember
You MUST remember
or I'll have you executed
I'm a poor man, your Majesty
You're a very poor speaker
I'm glad I've seen that done
I've so often read
in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some attempts
at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court," and I never understood what it meant till now
If that's all you know about it, you may stand down
I can't go no lower
I'm on the floor, as it is
Then you may SIT down
Come, that finished the guinea-pigs
Now we shall get
on better
I'd rather finish my tea
You may go
and just take his head off outside
Call the next witness
Give your evidence
Shan't
Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness
Well, if I must, I must
What are tarts made of
Pepper, mostly
Treacle
Collar that Dormouse
Behead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers
Never mind
Call the next
witness
Really, my dear,
YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead
ache
for they haven't
got much evidence YET
Alice
Here
Oh, I BEG your pardon
The trial cannot proceed
until
all the jurymen are back in their proper places -- ALL
not that it signifies much
I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial
one way up as the other
What do you know about this business
Nothing
Nothing WHATEVER
Nothing whatever
That's very important
UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course
UNimportant, of course, I meant
important -- unimportant -- unimportant -- important
important
unimportant
but it doesn't matter a bit
Silence
Rule
Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT
I'M not a mile high
You are
Nearly two miles high
Well, I shan't go, at any rate
besides, that's not a
regular rule: you invented it just now
It's the oldest rule in the book
Then it ought to be Number One
Consider your
verdict
There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty
this paper has just been picked
up
What's in it
I haven't opened it yet
but it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner to -- to somebody
It must have been that
unless it was written to
nobody, which isn't usual, you know
Who is it directed to
It isn't directed at all
in fact, there's
nothing written on the OUTSIDE
It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses
Are they in the prisoner's handwriting
No, they're not
and that's the queerest thing
about it
He must have imitated somebody else's hand
Please your Majesty
I didn't write it, and they
can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end
If you didn't sign it
that only makes the matter
worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your
name like an honest man
That PROVES his guilt
It proves nothing of the sort
Why, you don't even know
what they're about
Read them
Where shall I begin, please
your Majesty
Begin at the beginning
and go on till you
come to the end: then stop
They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
   She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

   He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
   If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

   I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
   They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.

   If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
   He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.

   My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
   An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.

   Don't let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
   A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me
That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet
so now let the jury
If any one of them can explain it
I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of
meaning in it
SHE doesn't believe there's an
atom of meaning in it
If there's no meaning in it
that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know
I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "-- SAID
I COULD NOT SWIM --" you can't swim, can you
Do I look like it
All right, so far
WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE --" that's the jury, of
course --"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO --" why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know
But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU
Why, there they are
Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again --"BEFORE SHE
HAD THIS FIT --" you never had fits, my dear, I think
Never
Then the words don't FIT you
It's a pun
Let the jury consider their verdict
No, no
Sentence first -- verdict afterwards
Stuff and nonsense
The idea of having the
sentence first
Hold your tongue
I won't
Off with her head
Who cares for you
You're nothing but a pack of cards
Wake up, Alice dear
Why, what a long sleep you've
had
Oh, I've had such a curious dream
It WAS a curious dream,
dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late
