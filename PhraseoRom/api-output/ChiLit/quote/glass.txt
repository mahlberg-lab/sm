Oh, you wicked little thing
Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You OUGHT,
Dinah, you know you ought
Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty
You'd have guessed
if you'd been up in the window with me -- only Dinah was making you tidy,
so you couldn't. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the
bonfire -- and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold, and
it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, we'll go and
see the bonfire to-morrow
Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty
when I saw all the mischief you had been
doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into
the snow! And you'd have deserved it, you little mischievous darling!
What have you got to say for yourself? Now don't interrupt me
I'm going to tell you all your faults.
Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this
morning. Now you can't deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What's that you
say
Her paw went into your
eye? Well, that's YOUR fault, for keeping your eyes open -- if you'd
shut them tight up, it wouldn't have happened. Now don't make any more
excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail
just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were
thirsty, were you? How do you know she wasn't thirsty too? Now for
number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn't
looking!

'That's three faults, Kitty, and you've not been punished for any of
them yet. You know I'm saving up all your punishments for Wednesday
week -- Suppose they had saved up all MY punishments
What WOULD they do at the end
of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came.
Or -- let me see -- suppose each punishment was to be going without a
dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without
fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn't mind THAT much! I'd far rather
go without them than eat them!

'Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft
it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside.
I wonder if the snow LOVES the trees and fields, that it kisses them so
gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt;
and perhaps it says, "Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes
again." And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress
themselves all in green, and dance about -- whenever the wind blows -- oh,
that's very pretty
And I do so WISH it was true! I'm sure the woods look sleepy
in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.

'Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don't smile, my dear, I'm asking it
seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as
if you understood it: and when I said "Check!" you purred! Well, it WAS
a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn't been for
that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces. Kitty, dear,
let's pretend
Let's pretend
Let's pretend we're kings and queens
Well, YOU can be one of them then, and I'LL be all the rest
Nurse! Do let's pretend that I'm a hungry hyaena, and you're a
bone
Let's
pretend that you're the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you
sat up and folded your arms, you'd look exactly like her. Now do try,
there's a dear
and if you're not
good directly
I'll put you through into Looking-glass
House. How would you like THAT
Now, if you'll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I'll tell you
all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there's the room you can
see through the glass -- that's just the same as our drawing room, only
the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a
chair -- all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could
see THAT bit! I want so much to know whether they've a fire in the
winter: you never CAN tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then
smoke comes up in that room too -- but that may be only pretence, just to
make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are something
like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because
I've held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in
the other room.

'How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if
they'd give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn't good
to drink -- But oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a
little PEEP of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the door
of our drawing-room wide open: and it's very like our passage as far
as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond.
Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into
Looking-glass House! I'm sure it's got, oh! such beautiful things in it!
Let's pretend there's a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty.
Let's pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get
through. Why, it's turning into a sort of mist now, I declare! It'll be
easy enough to get through
So I shall be as warm here as I was in the
old room
warmer, in fact, because there'll be no one
here to scold me away from the fire. Oh, what fun it'll be, when they
see me through the glass in here, and can't get at me
They don't keep this room so tidy as the other
Oh
Here are the Red King and the Red Queen
and there are the White King and the White
Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel -- and here are two castles
walking arm in arm -- I don't think they can hear me
and I'm nearly sure they can't see me. I feel
somehow as if I were invisible
It is the voice of my child
My precious Lily! My imperial kitten
Imperial fiddlestick
Mind the volcano
What volcano
Blew -- me -- up
Mind you come up -- the regular way -- don't get blown up
Why, you'll be hours and hours getting to the
table, at that rate. I'd far better help you, hadn't I
Oh! PLEASE don't make such faces, my dear
You make me laugh so that
I can hardly hold you! And don't keep your mouth so wide open! All the
ashes will get into it -- there, now I think you're tidy enough
I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very
ends of my whiskers
You haven't got any whiskers
The horror of that moment
I shall never, NEVER
forget
You will, though
if you don't make a memorandum of
it
My dear! I really MUST get a thinner pencil.
I can't manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that I
don't intend
What manner of things
THE WHITE KNIGHT IS SLIDING DOWN THE POKER. HE BALANCES
VERY BADLY
That's not a memorandum of YOUR feelings
for it's all in some language I don't know
Why, it's a Looking-glass book, of course! And if I hold it up to
a glass, the words will all go the right way again
Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.

     'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
     Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
      The frumious Bandersnatch
And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
     O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay
Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.


'It seems very pretty
but it's
RATHER hard to understand
Somehow it seems
to fill my head with ideas -- only I don't exactly know what they are!
However, SOMEBODY killed SOMETHING: that's clear, at any rate
But oh
if I don't make haste I
shall have to go back through the Looking-glass, before I've seen what
the rest of the house is like! Let's have a look at the garden first
I should see the garden far better
if I could
get to the top of that hill: and here's a path that leads straight to
it -- at least, no, it doesn't do that
but I suppose it will
at last. But how curiously it twists! It's more like a corkscrew than a
path! Well, THIS turn goes to the hill, I suppose -- no, it doesn't! This
goes straight back to the house! Well then, I'll try it the other way
It's no use talking about it
I'm NOT going in again yet. I know
I should have to get through the Looking-glass again -- back into the old
room -- and there'd be an end of all my adventures
I really
SHALL do it this time
Oh, it's too bad
I never saw such a house for getting in
the way! Never
O Tiger-lily
I WISH you could talk
We CAN talk
when there's anybody worth talking
to
And can ALL the flowers talk
As well as YOU can
And a great deal louder
It isn't manners for us to begin, you know
and I
really was wondering when you'd speak! Said I to myself, "Her face has
got SOME sense in it, though it's not a clever one!" Still, you're the
right colour, and that goes a long way
I don't care about the colour
If only her
petals curled up a little more, she'd be all right
Aren't you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody
to take care of you
There's the tree in the middle
what else is it good
for
But what could it do, if any danger came
It says "Bough-wough
that's why its branches are
called boughs
Didn't you know THAT
Silence, every one of you
They
know I can't get at them
or they wouldn't dare to do it
Never mind
If you don't
hold your tongues, I'll pick you
That's right
The daisies are worst of all. When
one speaks, they all begin together, and it's enough to make one wither
to hear the way they go on
How is it you can all talk so nicely
I've been in many gardens before,
but none of the flowers could talk
Put your hand down, and feel the ground
Then
you'll know why
It's very hard
but I don't see what that has
to do with it
In most gardens
they make the beds too soft -- so
that the flowers are always asleep
I never thought of that before
It's MY opinion that you never think AT ALL
I never saw anybody that looked stupider
Hold YOUR tongue
As if YOU ever saw anybody!
You keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there, till you know
no more what's going on in the world, than if you were a bud
Are there any more people in the garden besides me
There's one other flower in the garden that can move about like you
I wonder how you do it
You're always wondering
but she's more bushy than you are
Is she like me
There's another little girl in the garden, somewhere
Well, she has the same awkward shape as you
but she's
redder -- and her petals are shorter, I think
Her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia
not tumbled about anyhow, like yours
But that's not YOUR fault
you're beginning
to fade, you know -- and then one can't help one's petals getting a little
untidy
Does she ever come out here
I daresay you'll see her soon
She's one of the thorny
kind
Where does she wear the thorns
Why all round her head, of course
I was wondering
YOU hadn't got some too. I thought it was the regular rule
She's coming
I hear her footstep, thump, thump,
thump, along the gravel-walk
She's
grown a good deal
It's the fresh air that does it
wonderfully fine air
it is, out here
I think I'll go and meet her
You can't possibly do that
_I_ should advise you to
walk the other way
Where do you come from
And where are you going?
Look up, speak nicely, and don't twiddle your fingers all the time
I don't know what you mean by YOUR way
all the ways
about here belong to ME -- but why did you come out here at all
Curtsey while you're thinking what to say, it
saves time
I'll try it when I go home
the next time I'm a little late for dinner
It's time for you to answer now
open your mouth a LITTLE wider when you speak, and always say "your
Majesty
I only wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty
That's right
though, when you say "garden,"-- I'VE seen gardens,
compared with which this would be a wilderness
and I thought I'd
try and find my way to the top of that hill
_I_ could show you hills,
in comparison with which you'd call that a valley
No, I shouldn't
a hill CAN'T be a valley, you know. That would be nonsense
You may call it "nonsense" if you like
but I'VE heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as
sensible as a dictionary
I declare it's marked out just like a large chessboard
There ought to be some men moving about somewhere -- and so there
are
It's a great huge game of chess that's
being played -- all over the world -- if this IS the world at all, you know.
Oh, what fun it is! How I WISH I was one of them! I wouldn't mind being
a Pawn, if only I might join -- though of course I should LIKE to be a
Queen, best
That's easily managed. You
can be the White Queen's Pawn, if you like, as Lily's too young to
play; and you're in the Second Square to begin with: when you get to
the Eighth Square you'll be a Queen
Faster! Faster
I wonder if all the things
move along with us
Faster! Don't try to talk
Faster! Faster
Are we
nearly there
Nearly there
Why, we passed it ten minutes ago!
Faster
Now! Now
Faster! Faster
You may rest
a little now
Why, I do believe we've been
under this tree the whole time! Everything's just as it was
Of course it is
what would you have it
Well, in OUR country
you'd
generally get to somewhere else -- if you ran very fast for a long time,
as we've been doing
A slow sort of country
Now, HERE, you see, it takes
all the running YOU can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to
get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that
I'd rather not try, please
I'm quite content to stay
here -- only I AM so hot and thirsty
I know what YOU'D like
Have a biscuit
No
While you're refreshing yourself
I'll just take
the measurements
At the end of two yards
I shall give you your directions -- have another biscuit
No, thank you
one's QUITE enough
Thirst quenched, I hope
At the end of THREE yards I shall
repeat them -- for fear of your forgetting them. At the end of FOUR, I
shall say good-bye. And at the end of FIVE, I shall go
A pawn goes two squares
in its first move, you know. So you'll go VERY quickly through the Third
Square -- by railway, I should think -- and you'll find yourself in the
Fourth Square in no time. Well, THAT square belongs to Tweedledum and
Tweedledee -- the Fifth is mostly water -- the Sixth belongs to Humpty
Dumpty -- But you make no remark
I -- I didn't know I had to make one -- just then
You SHOULD have said, "It's extremely kind of you to tell me all
this"-- however, we'll suppose it said -- the Seventh Square is all
forest -- however, one of the Knights will show you the way -- and in the
Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and it's all feasting and
fun
Speak
in French when you can't think of the English for a thing -- turn out your
toes as you walk -- and remember who you are
good-bye
and she CAN run very fast
It's something very like
learning geography
Principal rivers -- there ARE none.
Principal mountains -- I'm on the only one, but I don't think it's got any
name. Principal towns -- why, what ARE those creatures, making honey down
there? They can't be bees -- nobody ever saw bees a mile off, you know
just
as if it was a regular bee
And what enormous flowers they must be
Something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks put
to them -- and what quantities of honey they must make! I think I'll go
down and -- no, I won't JUST yet
It'll never do to go down among them
without a good long branch to brush them away -- and what fun it'll be
when they ask me how I like my walk. I shall say --"Oh, I like it well
enough
only it
was so dusty and hot, and the elephants did tease so
I think I'll go down the other way
and
perhaps I may visit the elephants later on. Besides, I do so want to get
into the Third Square
Tickets, please
Now then! Show your ticket, child
like the chorus of
a song
Don't keep him waiting, child! Why, his time
is worth a thousand pounds a minute
I'm afraid I haven't got one
there
wasn't a ticket-office where I came from
There wasn't room for one where she came from. The land
there is worth a thousand pounds an inch
Don't make excuses
you should have bought one from
the engine-driver
The
man that drives the engine. Why, the smoke alone is worth a thousand
pounds a puff
Then there's no use in speaking
Better
say nothing at all. Language is worth a thousand pounds a word
I shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight, I know I shall
You're travelling the wrong way
So young a child
ought to know which way she's going, even if
she doesn't know her own name
She ought to know her way to the
ticket-office, even if she doesn't know her alphabet
She'll have to go
back from here as luggage
Change engines
It sounds like a horse
You might make a joke on
that -- something about "horse" and "hoarse," you know
She must be labelled
"Lass, with care," you know
What a number of people there are
in the carriage
She must go by post, as she's
got a head on her
She must be sent as a message by the telegraph
She must draw the train herself the rest of the way
Never mind what they all say, my dear, but take a
return-ticket every time the train stops
Indeed I shan't
I don't belong to
this railway journey at all -- I was in a wood just now -- and I wish I
could get back there
You might make a joke on THAT
something about "you WOULD if you could," you know
Don't tease so
if you're so anxious to have a joke made, why don't
you make one yourself
If it would only
sigh like other people
I know you are a friend
a dear friend, and
an old friend. And you won't hurt me, though I AM an insect
What kind of insect
What, then you don't
It's only a brook we have to jump over
However, it'll take us into the Fourth Square,
that's some comfort
about the size of a chicken
then you don't like all insects
I like them when they can talk
None of them ever talk,
where _I_ come from
What sort of insects do you rejoice in, where YOU come from
I don't REJOICE in insects at all
because I'm
rather afraid of them -- at least the large kinds. But I can tell you the
names of some of them
Of course they answer to their names
I never knew them to do it
What's the use of their having names
if they won't
answer to them
No use to THEM
but it's useful to the people who name
them, I suppose. If not, why do things have names at all
I can't say
Further on, in the wood down there,
they've got no names -- however, go on with your list of insects: you're
wasting time
Well, there's the Horse-fly
All right
half way up that bush, you'll see a
Rocking-horse-fly, if you look. It's made entirely of wood, and gets
about by swinging itself from branch to branch
What does it live on
Sap and sawdust
Go on with the list
And there's the Dragon-fly
Look on the branch above your head
and there you'll
find a snap-dragon-fly. Its body is made of plum-pudding, its wings of
holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy
And what does it live on
Frumenty and mince pie
and it makes its nest in a
Christmas box
And then there's the Butterfly
I wonder if that's the reason insects are so fond of flying
into candles -- because they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies
Crawling at your feet
you may observe a Bread-and-Butterfly. Its wings are thin
slices of Bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump
of sugar
And what does IT live on
Weak tea with cream in it
Supposing it couldn't find
any
Then it would die, of course
But that must happen very often
It always happens
I suppose you don't want to lose your
name
No, indeed
And yet I don't know
only think
how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it!
For instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons, she
would call out "come here --," and there she would have to leave off,
because there wouldn't be any name for her to call, and of course you
wouldn't have to go, you know
That would never do, I'm sure
the governess would never
think of excusing me lessons for that. If she couldn't remember my name,
she'd call me "Miss!" as the servants do
Well, if she said "Miss," and didn't say anything more
of course you'd miss your lessons. That's a joke. I wish YOU
had made it
Why do you wish _I_ had made it
It's a very bad one
You shouldn't make jokes
if it makes you so unhappy
for I certainly won't go BACK
This must be the wood
DASH
Alice
Well, at any rate it's a great comfort
after being so hot, to get into
the -- into WHAT
I mean to get under the -- under the -- under THIS, you
know
What DOES it call
itself, I wonder? I do believe it's got no name -- why, to be sure it
hasn't
Then it really HAS happened, after all! And now, who am I? I WILL
remember, if I can! I'm determined to do it
L, I KNOW it begins with L
Here then! Here then
What do you call yourself
I wish I knew
Nothing, just now
Think again
that won't do
Please, would you tell me
what YOU call yourself
I think that might help a
little
I'll tell you, if you'll move a little further on
I
can't remember here
I'm a Fawn
and, dear me! you're a human child
However, I
know my name now
that's SOME comfort. Alice -- Alice -- I won't
forget it again. And now, which of these finger-posts ought I to follow,
I wonder
I'll settle it
when the road divides and they
point different ways
TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE
I do believe
that they live in the same house! I
wonder I never thought of that before -- But I can't stay there long. I'll
just call and say "how d'you do?" and ask them the way out of the wood.
If I could only get to the Eighth Square before it gets dark
DEE
I suppose
they've each got "TWEEDLE" round at the back of the collar
DUM
If you think we're wax-works
you ought to pay, you know.
Wax-works weren't made to be looked at for nothing, nohow
Contrariwise
DEE
if you think we're alive,
you ought to speak
I'm sure I'm very sorry
Tweedledum and Tweedledee
      Agreed to have a battle;
     For Tweedledum said Tweedledee
      Had spoiled his nice new rattle.

     Just then flew down a monstrous crow,
      As black as a tar-barrel;
     Which frightened both the heroes so,
      They quite forgot their quarrel
I know what you're thinking about
but it isn't so,
nohow
Contrariwise
if it was so, it might be; and if
it were so, it would be; but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic
I was thinking
which is the best way out
of this wood: it's getting so dark. Would you tell me, please
First Boy
Nohow
Next Boy
Contrariwise
You've been wrong
The first thing in a visit is to
say "How d'ye do?" and shake hands
But it certainly WAS funny
to find myself singing
"HERE WE GO ROUND THE MULBERRY BUSH." I don't know when I began it, but
somehow I felt as if I'd been singing it a long long time
Four times
round is enough for one dance
It
would never do to say "How d'ye do?" NOW
we seem
to have got beyond that, somehow
I hope you're not much tired
Nohow. And thank you VERY much for asking
So much obliged
You like poetry
Ye-es, pretty well -- SOME poetry
Would you
tell me which road leads out of the wood
What shall I repeat to her
THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER" is the longest
The sun was shining
If it's VERY long
would you please tell me first which road
The sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
     He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright --
     And this was odd, because it was
      The middle of the night.

     The moon was shining sulkily,
      Because she thought the sun
     Had got no business to be there
      After the day was done --
     "It's very rude of him," she said,
      "To come and spoil the fun!"

     The sea was wet as wet could be,
      The sands were dry as dry.
     You could not see a cloud, because
      No cloud was in the sky:
     No birds were flying over head --
      There were no birds to fly.

     The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Were walking close at hand;
     They wept like anything to see
      Such quantities of sand:
     "If this were only cleared away,"
       They said, "it WOULD be grand!"

     "If seven maids with seven mops
      Swept it for half a year,
     Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
      "That they could get it clear?"
      "I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
      And shed a bitter tear.

     "O Oysters, come and walk with us!"
       The Walrus did beseech.
     "A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
      Along the briny beach:
     We cannot do with more than four,
      To give a hand to each."

     The eldest Oyster looked at him.
      But never a word he said:
     The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
      And shook his heavy head --
     Meaning to say he did not choose
      To leave the oyster-bed.

     But four young oysters hurried up,
      All eager for the treat:
     Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
      Their shoes were clean and neat --
     And this was odd, because, you know,
      They hadn't any feet.

     Four other Oysters followed them,
      And yet another four;
     And thick and fast they came at last,
      And more, and more, and more --
     All hopping through the frothy waves,
      And scrambling to the shore.

     The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Walked on a mile or so,
     And then they rested on a rock
      Conveniently low:
     And all the little Oysters stood
      And waited in a row.

     "The time has come," the Walrus said,
      "To talk of many things:
     Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing-wax --
      Of cabbages -- and kings --
     And why the sea is boiling hot --
      And whether pigs have wings."

     "But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
      "Before we have our chat;
     For some of us are out of breath,
      And all of us are fat!"
      "No hurry!" said the Carpenter.
      They thanked him much for that.

     "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
      "Is what we chiefly need:
     Pepper and vinegar besides
      Are very good indeed --
     Now if you're ready Oysters dear,
      We can begin to feed."

     "But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
      Turning a little blue,
     "After such kindness, that would be
      A dismal thing to do!"
      "The night is fine," the Walrus said
      "Do you admire the view?

     "It was so kind of you to come!
      And you are very nice!"
      The Carpenter said nothing but
      "Cut us another slice:
     I wish you were not quite so deaf --
      I've had to ask you twice!"

     "It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
      "To play them such a trick,
     After we've brought them out so far,
      And made them trot so quick!"
      The Carpenter said nothing but
      "The butter's spread too thick!"

     "I weep for you," the Walrus said.
      "I deeply sympathize."
      With sobs and tears he sorted out
      Those of the largest size.
     Holding his pocket handkerchief
      Before his streaming eyes.

     "O Oysters," said the Carpenter.
      "You've had a pleasant run!
     Shall we be trotting home again?"
       But answer came there none --
     And that was scarcely odd, because
      They'd eaten every one
I like the Walrus best
because you see he was a LITTLE
sorry for the poor oysters
He ate more than the Carpenter, though
You see he
held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter couldn't count how
many he took: contrariwise
That was mean
Then I like the Carpenter
best -- if he didn't eat so many as the Walrus
But he ate as many as he could get
Well! They were BOTH
very unpleasant characters
Are there any lions or tigers about here
It's only the Red King snoring
Come and look at him
Isn't he a LOVELY sight
fit to snore his head off
I'm afraid he'll catch cold with lying on the damp grass
He's dreaming now
and what do you think he's
dreaming about
Nobody can guess that
Why, about YOU
And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be
Where I am now, of course
Not you
You'd be nowhere. Why,
you're only a sort of thing in his dream
If that there King was to wake
you'd go
out -- bang!-- just like a candle
I shouldn't
Besides, if I'M only a sort
of thing in his dream, what are YOU, I should like to know
Hush! You'll
be waking him, I'm afraid, if you make so much noise
Well, it no use YOUR talking about waking him
when
you're only one of the things in his dream. You know very well you're
not real
I AM real
You won't make yourself a bit realler by crying
there's nothing to cry about
If I wasn't real
I shouldn't be able to cry
I hope you don't suppose those are real tears
I know they're talking nonsense
and it's
foolish to cry about it
At any rate I'd better be getting out of the
wood, for really it's coming on very dark. Do you think it's going to
rain
No, I don't think it is
at least -- not
under HERE. Nohow
But it may rain OUTSIDE
It may -- if it chooses
we've no objection.
Contrariwise
Selfish things
Do you see THAT
It's only a rattle
Not a rattleSNAKE, you know
only an old rattle -- quite old and
broken
I knew it was
It's spoilt, of course
You
needn't be so angry about an old rattle
But it isn't old
It's
new, I tell you -- I bought it yesterday -- my nice new RATTLE
looking more like a fish than anything
else
Of course you agree to have a battle
I suppose so
only SHE must help us to dress up, you know
I hope you're
a good hand at pinning and tying strings
Every
one of these things has got to go on, somehow or other
Really they'll be more like bundles of old clothes
than anything else, by the time they're ready
to keep his head
from being cut off
You know
it's one of the most serious things
that can possibly happen to one in a battle -- to get one's head cut off
Do I look very pale
Well -- yes -- a LITTLE
I'm very brave generally
only to-day I
happen to have a headache
And I'VE got a toothache
I'm far worse off than you
Then you'd better not fight to-day
We MUST have a bit of a fight, but I don't care about going on long
What's the time now
Half-past four
Let's fight till six, and then have dinner
Very well
and SHE can watch us -- only
you'd better not come VERY close
I generally hit everything
I can see -- when I get really excited
And _I_ hit everything within reach
whether I can
see it or not
You must hit the TREES pretty often, I should think
I don't suppose
there'll be a tree left standing, for ever so far round, by
the time we've finished
And all about a rattle
I shouldn't have minded it so much
if it hadn't
been a new one
I wish the monstrous crow would come
There's only one sword, you know
but you can have the umbrella -- it's quite as sharp. Only we must begin
quick. It's getting as dark as it can
And darker
What a thick black cloud that is
And how fast it comes! Why, I do believe it's got wings
It's the crow
It can never get at me HERE
it's far too large to
squeeze itself in among the trees. But I wish it wouldn't flap its wings
so -- it makes quite a hurricane in the wood -- here's somebody's shawl
being blown away
I'm very glad I happened to be in the way
bread-and-butter, bread-and-butter
Am I addressing the White Queen
Well, yes, if you call that a-dressing
It isn't MY
notion of the thing, at all
If your
Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, I'll do it as well as
I can
But I don't want it done at all
I've been
a-dressing myself for the last two hours
Every
single thing's crooked
and she's all over
pins!-- may I put your shawl straight for you
I don't know what's the matter with it
It's out of temper, I think. I've pinned it here, and
I've pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it
It CAN'T go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side
and, dear me, what a state
your hair is in
The brush has got entangled in it
And I
lost the comb yesterday
Come, you look rather better now
But really you should have a lady's maid
I'm sure I'll take you with pleasure
Twopence a
week, and jam every other day
I don't want you to hire
ME -- and I don't care for jam
It's very good jam
Well, I don't want any TO-DAY, at any rate
You couldn't have it if you DID want it
The rule is,
jam to-morrow and jam yesterday -- but never jam to-day
It MUST come sometimes to "jam to-day
No, it can't
It's jam every OTHER day: to-day isn't
any OTHER day, you know
I don't understand you
It's dreadfully confusing
That's the effect of living backwards
it
always makes one a little giddy at first
Living backwards
I never heard
of such a thing
but there's one great advantage in it, that one's memory works both
ways
I'm sure MINE only works one way
I can't remember
things before they happen
It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards
What sort of things do YOU remember best
Oh, things that happened the week after next
For instance, now
there's the King's
Messenger. He's in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesn't
even begin till next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of
all
Suppose he never commits the crime
That would be all the better, wouldn't it
Of course it would be all
the better
but it wouldn't be all the better his being
punished
You're wrong THERE, at any rate
were YOU ever
punished
Only for faults
And you were all the better for it, I know
Yes, but then I HAD done the things I was punished for
that makes all the difference
But if you HADN'T done them
that would have been
better still; better, and better, and better
better
There's a mistake somewhere
Oh, oh, oh
My finger's bleeding! Oh, oh, oh, oh
What IS the matter
Have you pricked your finger
I haven't pricked it YET
but I soon shall -- oh, oh,
oh
When do you expect to do it
When I fasten my shawl again
the brooch
will come undone directly. Oh, oh
Take care
You're holding it all crooked
That accounts for the bleeding, you see
Now you understand the way things happen here
But why don't you scream now
Why, I've done all the screaming already
What would
be the good of having it all over again
The crow must have flown away, I
think
I'm so glad it's gone. I thought it was the night
coming on
I wish _I_ could manage to be glad
Only I never
can remember the rule. You must be very happy, living in this wood, and
being glad whenever you like
Only it is so VERY lonely here
Oh, don't go on like that
Consider what a great girl you are. Consider what a long way
you've come to-day. Consider what o'clock it is. Consider anything, only
don't cry
Can YOU keep from crying by considering things
That's the way it's done
nobody
can do two things at once, you know. Let's consider your age to begin
with -- how old are you
I'm seven and a half exactly
I can believe
it without that. Now I'll give YOU something to believe. I'm just one
hundred and one, five months and a day
I can't believe THAT
Can't you
Try again: draw a long
breath, and shut your eyes
There's no use trying
one CAN'T believe
impossible things
I daresay you haven't had much practice
When I was
your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've
believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. There goes
the shawl again
I've got it
Now you
shall see me pin it on again, all by myself
Then I hope your finger is better now
Oh, much better
Much be-etter! Be-etter! Be-e-e-etter! Be-e-ehh
What is it you want to buy
I don't QUITE know yet
I should like to
look all round me first, if I might
You may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like
but you can't look ALL round you -- unless you've got eyes at the
back of your head
Things flow about so here
And this one
is the most provoking of all -- but I'll tell you what
I'll follow it up to the very top shelf of
all. It'll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, I expect
Are you a child or a teetotum
You'll make me giddy soon, if you go on turning round
like that
How CAN she knit with so many
She gets more and more like a porcupine every minute
Can you row
Yes, a little -- but not on land -- and not with needles
Feather
Feather! Feather
You'll
be catching a crab directly
A dear little crab
I should like that
Didn't you hear me say "Feather
Indeed I did
you've said it very often -- and very loud.
Please, where ARE the crabs
In the water, of course
Feather, I say
WHY do you say "feather" so often
I'm not a bird
You are
you're a little goose
Oh, please! There are some scented rushes
There really are -- and SUCH beauties
em
em away
No, but I meant -- please, may we wait and pick some
If
you don't mind stopping the boat for a minute
How am _I_ to stop it
If you leave off rowing, it'll
stop of itself
I only hope the boat won't tipple over
Oh, WHAT
a lovely one! Only I couldn't quite reach it
almost as if it happened on purpose
The prettiest are always further
Oh, oh,
oh
That was
a nice crab you caught
Was it? I didn't see it
I wish it hadn't let go -- I should
so like to see a little crab to take home with me
Are there many crabs here
Crabs, and all sorts of things
plenty of choice,
only make up your mind. Now, what DO you want to buy
To buy
I should like to buy an egg, please
How do you
sell them
Fivepence farthing for one -- Twopence for two
Then two are cheaper than one
Only you MUST eat them both, if you buy two
Then I'll have ONE, please
They mightn't be at all nice,
you know
I
never put things into people's hands -- that would never do -- you must get
it for yourself
I wonder WHY it wouldn't do
The egg seems to get further away the more I walk towards it. Let me
see, is this a chair? Why, it's got branches, I declare! How very odd to
find trees growing here! And actually here's a little brook! Well, this
is the very queerest shop I ever saw
It can't be anybody else
I'm as certain of it, as if his name were written all over
his face
And how exactly like an egg he is
It's VERY provoking
to be called an egg -- VERY
I said you LOOKED like an egg, Sir
And some
eggs are very pretty, you know
Some people
have
no more sense than a baby
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall:
     Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
     All the King's horses and all the King's men
     Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty in his place again
That last line is much too long for the poetry
Don't stand there chattering to yourself like that
but tell me your name and your
business
My NAME is Alice, but
It's a stupid enough name
What does it mean
MUST a name mean something
Of course it must
MY name
means the shape I am -- and a good handsome shape it is, too. With a name
like yours, you might be any shape, almost
Why do you sit out here all alone
Why, because there's nobody with me
Did you
think I didn't know the answer to THAT? Ask another
Don't you think you'd be safer down on the ground
That wall is so VERY narrow
What tremendously easy riddles you ask
Of
course I don't think so! Why, if ever I DID fall off -- which there's no
chance of -- but IF I did
IF I did fall
THE KING HAS PROMISED ME -- ah, you may turn pale, if you like!
You didn't think I was going to say that, did you? THE KING HAS PROMISED ME --
WITH HIS VERY OWN MOUTH -- to -- to
To send all his horses and all his men
Now I declare that's too bad
You've been listening at doors -- and behind trees -- and
down chimneys -- or you couldn't have known it
I haven't, indeed
It's in a book
Ah, well! They may write such things in a BOOK
That's what you call a History of England, that is.
Now, take a good look at me! I'm one that has spoken to a King, _I_ am:
mayhap you'll never see such another: and to show you I'm not proud, you
may shake hands with me
If he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet
behind
and then I don't know what would happen to his
head! I'm afraid it would come off
Yes, all his horses and all his men
They'd
pick me up again in a minute, THEY would! However, this conversation is
going on a little too fast: let's go back to the last remark but one
I'm afraid I can't quite remember it
In that case we start fresh
and it's my turn
to choose a subject
He talks about it just as if it was a game
So here's a question for you. How old did you say you
were
Seven years and six months
Wrong
You never said a word
like it
I though you meant "How old ARE you
If I'd meant that, I'd have said it
Seven years and six months
An
uncomfortable sort of age. Now if you'd asked MY advice, I'd have said
"Leave off at seven"-- but it's too late now
I never ask advice about growing
Too proud
I mean
that one can't help growing older
ONE can't, perhaps
but TWO can. With proper
assistance, you might have left off at seven
What a beautiful belt you've got on
At least
a beautiful
cravat, I should have said -- no, a belt, I mean -- I beg your pardon
If I only knew
which was neck and which was waist
It is a -- MOST -- PROVOKING -- thing
when a person
doesn't know a cravat from a belt
I know it's very ignorant of me
It's a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. It's a present
from the White King and Queen. There now
Is it really
They gave it me
they gave it
me -- for an un-birthday present
I beg your pardon
I'm not offended
I mean, what IS an un-birthday present
A present given when it isn't your birthday, of course
I like birthday presents best
You don't know what you're talking about
How
many days are there in a year
Three hundred and sixty-five
And how many birthdays have you
One
And if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five, what remains
Three hundred and sixty-four, of course
I'd rather see that done on paper
That seems to
be done right
You're holding it upside down
To be sure I was
I thought it looked a little queer. As I was saying, that SEEMS
to be done right -- though I haven't time to look it over thoroughly just
now -- and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty-four days
when you might get un-birthday presents
Certainly
And only ONE for birthday presents, you know. There's glory for you
I don't know what you mean by "glory
Of course you don't -- till I tell
you. I meant "there's a nice knock-down argument for you
But "glory" doesn't mean "a nice knock-down argument
When _I_ use a word
it
means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less
The question is
whether you CAN make words mean so many
different things
The question is
which is to be master -- that's
all
They've a temper, some of them -- particularly verbs,
they're the proudest -- adjectives you can do anything with, but not
verbs -- however, _I_ can manage the whole lot of them! Impenetrability!
That's what _I_ say
Would you tell me, please
what that means
Now you talk like a reasonable child
I meant by "impenetrability" that we've had enough of
that subject, and it would be just as well if you'd mention what you
mean to do next, as I suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest
of your life
That's a great deal to make one word mean
When I make a word do a lot of work like that
I
always pay it extra
Oh
em come round me of a Saturday night
for to get
their wages, you know
You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir
Would you
kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called "Jabberwocky
Let's hear it
I can explain all the poems that
were ever invented -- and a good many that haven't been invented just
yet
Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.

'That's enough to begin with
there
are plenty of hard words there. "BRILLIG" means four o'clock in the
afternoon -- the time when you begin BROILING things for dinner
That'll do very well
and "SLITHY
Well, "SLITHY" means "lithe and slimy." "Lithe" is the same as
"active." You see it's like a portmanteau -- there are two meanings packed
up into one word
I see it now
and what are "TOVES
Well, "TOVES" are something like badgers -- they're something like
lizards -- and they're something like corkscrews
They must be very curious looking creatures
They are that
also they make their nests under
sun-dials -- also they live on cheese
And what's the "GYRE" and to "GIMBLE
To "GYRE" is to go round and round like a gyroscope. To "GIMBLE" is to
make holes like a gimlet
And "THE WABE" is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, I suppose
Of course it is. It's called "WABE," you know, because it goes a long
way before it, and a long way behind it
And a long way beyond it on each side
Exactly so. Well, then, "MIMSY" is "flimsy and miserable" (there's
another portmanteau for you). And a "BOROGOVE" is a thin shabby-looking
bird with its feathers sticking out all round -- something like a live
mop
And then "MOME RATHS
I'm afraid I'm giving you a great
deal of trouble
Well, a "RATH" is a sort of green pig: but "MOME" I'm not certain
about. I think it's short for "from home"-- meaning that they'd lost
their way, you know
And what does "OUTGRABE" mean
Well, "OUTGRABING" is something between bellowing and whistling, with a
kind of sneeze in the middle: however, you'll hear it done, maybe -- down
in the wood yonder -- and when you've once heard it you'll be QUITE
content. Who's been repeating all that hard stuff to you
I read it in a book
But I had some poetry repeated to
me, much easier than that, by -- Tweedledee, I think it was
As to poetry, you know
_I_ can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it comes
to that
Oh, it needn't come to that
The piece I'm going to repeat
was written entirely for your amusement
I see you don't
If you can SEE whether I'm singing or not, you've sharper eyes than
most
In spring, when woods are getting green,
     I'll try and tell you what I mean
Thank you very much
In summer, when the days are long,
     Perhaps you'll understand the song:
     In autumn, when the leaves are brown,
     Take pen and ink, and write it down
I will, if I can remember it so long
You needn't go on making remarks like that
they're not sensible, and they put me out
I sent a message to the fish:
     I told them "This is what I wish."

     The little fishes of the sea,
     They sent an answer back to me.

     The little fishes' answer was
     "We cannot do it, Sir, because
I'm afraid I don't quite understand
It gets easier further on
I sent to them again to say
     "It will be better to obey."

     The fishes answered with a grin,
     "Why, what a temper you are in!"

     I told them once, I told them twice:
     They would not listen to advice.

     I took a kettle large and new,
     Fit for the deed I had to do.

     My heart went hop, my heart went thump;
     I filled the kettle at the pump.

     Then some one came to me and said,
     "The little fishes are in bed."

     I said to him, I said it plain,
     "Then you must wake them up again."

     I said it very loud and clear;
     I went and shouted in his ear
I wouldn't have been the
messenger for ANYTHING
But he was very stiff and proud;
     He said "You needn't shout so loud!"

     And he was very proud and stiff;
     He said "I'd go and wake them, if --"

     I took a corkscrew from the shelf:
     I went to wake them up myself.

     And when I found the door was locked,
     I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked.

     And when I found the door was shut,
     I tried to turn the handle, but
Is that all
That's all
Good-bye
Good-bye, till we meet
again
I shouldn't know you again if we DID meet
you're so
exactly like other people
The face is what one goes by, generally
That's just what I complain of
Your face is the
same as everybody has -- the two eyes, so
nose in the middle, mouth under. It's always the
same. Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for
instance -- or the mouth at the top -- that would be SOME help
It wouldn't look nice
Wait till you've tried
Good-bye
Of all the
unsatisfactory
of all the unsatisfactory people I EVER
met
I've sent them all
Did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came
through the wood
Yes, I did
several thousand, I should think
Four thousand two hundred and seven, that's the exact number
I couldn't send all the horses, you know,
because two of them are wanted in the game. And I haven't sent the two
Messengers, either. They're both gone to the town. Just look along the
road, and tell me if you can see either of them
I see nobody on the road
I only wish _I_ had such eyes
To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why, it's as much
as _I_ can do to see real people, by this light
I see somebody now
But he's coming very slowly -- and what curious
attitudes he goes into
Not at all
He's an Anglo-Saxon Messenger -- and those
are Anglo-Saxon attitudes. He only does them when he's happy. His name
is Haigha
mayor
I love my love with an H
because
he is Happy. I hate him with an H, because he is Hideous. I fed him
with -- with -- with Ham-sandwiches and Hay. His name is Haigha, and he
lives
He lives on the Hill
The other Messenger's called
Hatta. I must have TWO, you know -- to come and go. One to come, and one
to go
I beg your pardon
It isn't respectable to beg
I only meant that I didn't understand
Why one to come
and one to go
Didn't I tell you
I must have Two -- to
fetch and carry. One to fetch, and one to carry
This young lady loves you with an H
You alarm me
I feel faint -- Give me a ham sandwich
Another sandwich
There's nothing but hay left now
Hay, then
There's nothing
like eating hay when you're faint
I should think throwing cold water over you would be better
or some sal-volatile
I didn't say there was nothing BETTER
I said there
was nothing LIKE it
Who did you pass on the road
Nobody
Quite right
this young lady saw him too. So of course
Nobody walks slower than you
I do my best
I'm sure nobody
walks much faster than I do
He can't do that
or else he'd have been here first.
However, now you've got your breath, you may tell us what's happened in
the town
I'll whisper it
They're at it again
Do you call THAT a whisper
If you do such a thing again, I'll have you buttered!
It went through and through my head like an earthquake
It would have to be a very tiny earthquake
Who are at
it again
Why the Lion and the Unicorn, of course
Fighting for the crown
Yes, to be sure
and the best of the joke is, that
it's MY crown all the while! Let's run and see them
The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown:
   The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town.
   Some gave them white bread, some gave them brown;
   Some gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town
Does -- the one -- that wins -- get the crown
Dear me, no
What an idea
Would you -- be good enough
to stop a minute -- just to get -- one's breath again
I'm GOOD enough
only I'm not strong enough. You see,
a minute goes by so fearfully quick. You might as well try to stop a
Bandersnatch
He's only just out of prison, and he hadn't finished his tea when
he was sent in
and they only give them
oyster-shells in there -- so you see he's very hungry and thirsty. How
are you, dear child
Were you happy in prison, dear child
Speak, can't you
Speak, won't you
How are they getting on with the
fight
They're getting on very well
each of them has been down about eighty-seven times
Then I suppose they'll soon bring the white bread and the brown
em now
this is a bit of it as I'm
eating
Ten minutes allowed for
refreshments
I don't think they'll fight any more to-day
go and order the drums to begin
Look, look
There's the
White Queen running across the country! She came flying out of the wood
over yonder -- How fast those Queens CAN run
There's some enemy after her, no doubt
That wood's full of them
But aren't you going to run and help her
No use, no use
She runs so fearfully quick. You might
as well try to catch a Bandersnatch! But I'll make a memorandum about
her, if you like -- She's a dear good creature
Do you spell "creature" with
a double "e
I had the best of it this time
A little -- a little
You shouldn't
have run him through with your horn, you know
It didn't hurt him
What -- is -- this
This is a child
We only found it to-day. It's as large as life,
and twice as natural
I always thought they were fabulous monsters
Is it
alive
It can talk
Talk, child
Do
you know, I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters, too! I never
saw one alive before
Well, now that we HAVE seen each other
if you'll
believe in me, I'll believe in you. Is that a bargain
Yes, if you like
Come, fetch out the plum-cake, old man
None of your brown bread for me
Certainly -- certainly
Open
the bag
Quick! Not that one -- that's full of hay
What's this
Ah, what IS it, now
You'll never guess!
_I_ couldn't
Are you animal -- vegetable -- or
mineral
It's a fabulous monster
Then hand round the plum-cake, Monster
And sit down, both of you
fair play with the cake, you know
What a fight we might have for the crown, NOW
I should win easy
I'm not so sure of that
Why, I beat you all round the town, you chicken
All round the town
That's a good long way. Did you go by the old bridge, or the
market-place? You get the best view by the old bridge
I'm sure I don't know
There was too much dust to see anything. What a time the Monster is,
cutting up that cake
It's
very provoking
I've cut several slices already,
but they always join on again
You don't know how to manage Looking-glass cakes
Hand it round first, and cut it afterwards
NOW cut it up
I say, this isn't fair
The Monster has given the
Lion twice as much as me
She's kept none for herself, anyhow
Do you like
plum-cake, Monster
If THAT doesn't "drum them out of town
nothing ever will
So I wasn't dreaming, after all
unless -- unless we're all part of the same dream. Only
I do hope it's MY dream, and not the Red King's! I don't like belonging
to another person's dream
I've a great mind to go and wake him, and see what happens
Ahoy! Ahoy! Check
You're my prisoner
You're
my
Ahoy! Ahoy! Check
She's MY prisoner, you know
Yes, but then _I_ came and rescued her
Well, we must fight for her, then
You will observe the Rules of Battle, of course
I always do
I wonder, now, what the Rules of Battle are
one
Rule seems to be, that if one Knight hits the other, he knocks him off
his horse, and if he misses, he tumbles off himself -- and another Rule
seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms, as if they were
Punch and Judy -- What a noise they make when they tumble! Just like
a whole set of fire-irons falling into the fender! And how quiet the
horses are! They let them get on and off them just as if they were
tables
It was a glorious victory, wasn't it
I don't know
I don't want to be anybody's
prisoner. I want to be a Queen
So you will, when you've crossed the next brook
I'll see you safe to the end of the wood -- and then I must go
back, you know. That's the end of my move
Thank you very much
May I help you off with your
helmet
Now one can breathe more easily
I see you're admiring my little box
It's my own invention -- to keep clothes and sandwiches in. You see
I carry it upside-down, so that the rain can't get in
But the things can get OUT
Do you know the
lid's open
I didn't know it
Then all the things must have fallen out! And the box is no
use without them
Can you guess why I did that
In hopes some bees may make a nest in it -- then I should get the honey
But you've got a bee-hive -- or something like one -- fastened to the
saddle
Yes, it's a very good bee-hive
one of the best kind. But not a single bee has come near it yet.
And the other thing is a mouse-trap. I suppose the mice keep the bees
out -- or the bees keep the mice out, I don't know which
I was wondering what the mouse-trap was for
It isn't
very likely there would be any mice on the horse's back
Not very likely, perhaps
but if they DO come, I
don't choose to have them running all about
You see
it's as well to be provided for
EVERYTHING. That's the reason the horse has all those anklets round his
feet
But what are they for
To guard against the bites of sharks
It's an
invention of my own. And now help me on. I'll go with you to the end of
the wood -- What's the dish for
It's meant for plum-cake
We'd better take it with us
It'll come in handy if
we find any plum-cake. Help me to get it into this bag
It's rather a tight fit, you see
There are so many candlesticks in the bag
I hope you've got your hair well fastened on
Only in the usual way
That's hardly enough
You see the wind is so VERY
strong here. It's as strong as soup
Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off
Not yet
But I've got a plan for keeping it from
FALLING off
I should like to hear it, very much
First you take an upright stick
Then you make your
hair creep up it, like a fruit-tree. Now the reason hair falls off is
because it hangs DOWN -- things never fall UPWARDS, you know. It's a plan
of my own invention. You may try it if you like
I'm afraid you've not had much practice in riding
What makes you say that
Because people don't fall off quite so often, when they've had much
practice
I've had plenty of practice
plenty of
practice
Indeed
The great art of riding
is to keep
I hope no bones are broken
None to speak of
The great art of riding, as I was saying, is -- to keep
your balance properly. Like this, you know
Plenty of practice
Plenty of practice
It's too ridiculous
You ought to have a wooden horse on wheels, that you ought
Does that kind go smoothly
Much more smoothly than a live horse
I'll get one
One or
two -- several
I'm a great hand at inventing things. Now, I daresay you noticed, that
last time you picked me up, that I was looking rather thoughtful
You WERE a little grave
Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gate -- would
you like to hear it
Very much indeed
I'll tell you how I came to think of it
You see, I
said to myself, "The only difficulty is with the feet: the HEAD is high
enough already." Now, first I put my head on the top of the gate -- then I
stand on my head -- then the feet are high enough, you see -- then I'm over,
you see
Yes, I suppose you'd be over when that was done
but don't you think it would be rather hard
I haven't tried it yet
so I can't tell for
certain -- but I'm afraid it WOULD be a little hard
What a curious helmet you've got
Is that your
invention too
Yes
but I've invented a better one than that -- like
a sugar loaf. When I used to wear it, if I fell off the horse, it always
touched the ground directly. So I had a VERY little way to fall, you
see -- But there WAS the danger of falling INTO it, to be sure. That
happened to me once -- and the worst of it was, before I could get out
again, the other White Knight came and put it on. He thought it was his
own helmet
I'm afraid you must have hurt him
being on the top of his head
I had to kick him, of course
And
then he took the helmet off again -- but it took hours and hours to get me
out. I was as fast as -- as lightning, you know
But that's a different kind of fastness
It was all kinds of fastness with me, I can
assure you
All kinds of fastness
but it was careless of him to put another man's helmet
on -- with the man in it, too
How CAN you go on talking so quietly, head downwards
What does it matter where
my body happens to be
My mind goes on working all the same.
In fact, the more head downwards I am, the more I keep inventing new
things
Now the cleverest thing of the sort that I ever did
was inventing a new pudding during the meat-course
In time to have it cooked for the next course
Well,
not the NEXT course
no,
certainly not the next COURSE
Then it would have to be the next day. I suppose you wouldn't have two
pudding-courses in one dinner
Well, not the NEXT day
not the next
DAY. In fact
I don't believe that pudding ever WAS cooked! In fact,
I don't believe that pudding ever WILL be cooked! And yet it was a very
clever pudding to invent
What did you mean it to be made of
It began with blotting paper
That wouldn't be very nice, I'm afraid
Not very nice ALONE
but you've no
idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other things -- such as
gunpowder and sealing-wax. And here I must leave you
You are sad
let me sing you a
song to comfort you
Is it very long
It's long
but very, VERY beautiful. Everybody that
hears me sing it -- either it brings the TEARS into their eyes, or else
Or else what
Or else it doesn't, you know. The name of the song is called "HADDOCKS
Oh, that's the name of the song, is it
No, you don't understand
That's what the name is CALLED. The name really IS "THE AGED AGED
MAN
Then I ought to have said "That's what the SONG is called
No, you oughtn't: that's quite another thing! The SONG is called "WAYS
AND MEANS": but that's only what it's CALLED, you know
Well, what IS the song, then
I was coming to that
The song really IS "A-SITTING
ON A GATE": and the tune's my own invention
But the tune ISN'T his own invention
it's "I
GIVE THEE ALL, I CAN NO MORE
I'll tell thee everything I can;
      There's little to relate.
     I saw an aged aged man,
      A-sitting on a gate.
     "Who are you, aged man?" I said,
      "and how is it you live?"
      And his answer trickled through my head
      Like water through a sieve.

     He said "I look for butterflies
      That sleep among the wheat:
     I make them into mutton-pies,
      And sell them in the street.
     I sell them unto men," he said,
      "Who sail on stormy seas;
     And that's the way I get my bread --
      A trifle, if you please."

     But I was thinking of a plan
      To dye one's whiskers green,
     And always use so large a fan
      That they could not be seen.
     So, having no reply to give
      To what the old man said,
     I cried, "Come, tell me how you live!"
       And thumped him on the head.

     His accents mild took up the tale:
      He said "I go my ways,
     And when I find a mountain-rill,
      I set it in a blaze;
     And thence they make a stuff they call
      Rolands' Macassar Oil --
     Yet twopence-halfpenny is all
      They give me for my toil."

     But I was thinking of a way
      To feed oneself on batter,
     And so go on from day to day
      Getting a little fatter.
     I shook him well from side to side,
      Until his face was blue:
     "Come, tell me how you live," I cried,
      "And what it is you do!"

     He said "I hunt for haddocks' eyes
      Among the heather bright,
     And work them into waistcoat-buttons
      In the silent night.
     And these I do not sell for gold
      Or coin of silvery shine
     But for a copper halfpenny,
      And that will purchase nine.

     "I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,
      Or set limed twigs for crabs;
     I sometimes search the grassy knolls
      For wheels of Hansom-cabs.
     And that's the way" (he gave a wink)
      "By which I get my wealth --
     And very gladly will I drink
      Your Honour's noble health."

     I heard him then, for I had just
      Completed my design
     To keep the Menai bridge from rust
      By boiling it in wine.
     I thanked him much for telling me
      The way he got his wealth,
     But chiefly for his wish that he
      Might drink my noble health.

     And now, if e'er by chance I put
      My fingers into glue
     Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
      Into a left-hand shoe,
     Or if I drop upon my toe
      A very heavy weight,
     I weep, for it reminds me so,
      Of that old man I used to know --

     Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow,
     Whose hair was whiter than the snow,
     Whose face was very like a crow,
     With eyes, like cinders, all aglow,
     Who seemed distracted with his woe,
     Who rocked his body to and fro,
     And muttered mumblingly and low,
     As if his mouth were full of dough,
     Who snorted like a buffalo --
     That summer evening, long ago,
      A-sitting on a gate
You've only a few yards to go
down the hill and over
that little brook, and then you'll be a Queen -- But you'll stay and
see me off first
I shan't be long. You'll wait and wave
your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the road? I think it'll
encourage me, you see
Of course I'll wait
and thank you very much for coming
so far -- and for the song -- I liked it very much
I hope so
but you didn't cry so much as
I thought you would
It won't take long to see him OFF, I expect
There he goes! Right on his head as
usual! However, he gets on again pretty easily -- that comes of having so
many things hung round the horse
I hope it encouraged him
and now for the last brook, and to be a Queen! How grand it
sounds
The
Eighth Square at last
Oh, how glad I am to get
here! And what IS this on my head
But how CAN it have got there without my knowing it
Well, this IS grand
I never expected I should be a Queen
so soon -- and I'll tell you what it is, your majesty
it'll
never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that! Queens have
to be dignified, you know
and if I really am a Queen
I shall be able to manage it quite well
in time
Please, would
you tell me
Speak when you're spoken to
But if everybody obeyed that rule
and if you only spoke when you were spoken to,
and the other person always waited for YOU to begin, you see nobody
would ever say anything, so that
Ridiculous
Why, don't you see, child
What do you mean by "If you
really are a Queen"? What right have you to call yourself so? You can't
be a Queen, you know, till you've passed the proper examination. And the
sooner we begin it, the better
I only said "if
She SAYS she only said "if
But she said a great deal more than that
Oh, ever so much more than that
So you did, you know
Always speak the
truth -- think before you speak -- and write it down afterwards
I'm sure I didn't mean
That's just what I complain of! You SHOULD have meant! What do you
suppose is the use of child without any meaning? Even a joke should
have some meaning -- and a child's more important than a joke, I hope. You
couldn't deny that, even if you tried with both hands
I don't deny things with my HANDS
Nobody said you did
I said you couldn't if you
tried
She's in that state of mind
that she wants to
deny SOMETHING -- only she doesn't know what to deny
A nasty, vicious temper
I invite
you to Alice's dinner-party this afternoon
And I invite YOU
I didn't know I was to have a party at all
but if there
is to be one, I think _I_ ought to invite the guests
We gave you the opportunity of doing it
but
I daresay you've not had many lessons in manners yet
Manners are not taught in lessons
Lessons teach you to
do sums, and things of that sort
And you do Addition
What's one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one
I don't know
I lost count
She can't do Addition
Can you do
Subtraction? Take nine from eight
Nine from eight I can't, you know
but
She can't do Subtraction
Can you do Division?
Divide a loaf by a knife -- what's the answer to that
I suppose
Bread-and-butter, of course. Try another Subtraction sum. Take a bone
from a dog: what remains
The bone wouldn't remain, of course, if I took
it -- and the dog wouldn't remain; it would come to bite me -- and I'm sure
I shouldn't remain
Then you think nothing would remain
I think that's the answer
Wrong, as usual
the dog's temper would remain
But I don't see how
Why, look here
The dog would lose its temper,
wouldn't it
Perhaps it would
Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain
They might go different ways
What dreadful nonsense we ARE
talking
She can't do sums a BIT
Can YOU do sums
I can do Addition, if you give me
time -- but I can't do Subtraction, under ANY circumstances
Of course you know your A B C
To be sure I do
So do I
we'll often say it over together,
dear. And I'll tell you a secret -- I can read words of one letter! Isn't
THAT grand! However, don't be discouraged. You'll come to it in time
Can you answer useful questions
How is bread made
I know THAT
You take some flour
Where do you pick the flower
In a garden, or
in the hedges
Well, it isn't PICKED at all
it's GROUND
How many acres of ground
You mustn't leave out
so many things
Fan her head
She'll be feverish
after so much thinking
She's all right again now
Do you know Languages?
What's the French for fiddle-de-dee
Fiddle-de-dee's not English
Who ever said it was
If you'll
tell me what language "fiddle-de-dee" is, I'll tell you the French for
it
Queens never
make bargains
I wish Queens never asked questions
Don't let us quarrel
What
is the cause of lightning
The cause of lightning
is the thunder -- no, no
I meant the other way
It's too late to correct it
when you've once
said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences
Which reminds me
we had SUCH a thunderstorm last
Tuesday -- I mean one of the last set of Tuesdays, you know
In OUR country
there's only one day
at a time
That's a poor thin way of doing things. Now HERE,
we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and sometimes
in the winter we take as many as five nights together -- for warmth, you
know
Are five nights warmer than one night, then
Five times as warm, of course
But they should be five times as COLD, by the same rule
Just so
Five times as warm, AND five times
as cold -- just as I'm five times as rich as you are, AND five times as
clever
It's exactly like a riddle with no
answer
Humpty Dumpty saw it too
He came to the door with a corkscrew
in his hand
What did he want
He said he WOULD come in
because he was
looking for a hippopotamus. Now, as it happened, there wasn't such a
thing in the house, that morning
Is there generally
Well, only on Thursdays
I know what he came for
he wanted to punish the fish,
because
It was SUCH a thunderstorm, you can't
think
She NEVER could, you know
And part of
the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got in -- and it went
rolling round the room in great lumps -- and knocking over the tables and
things -- till I was so frightened, I couldn't remember my own name
I never should TRY to remember my name in the
middle of an accident! Where would be the use of it
Your Majesty must excuse her
she means well, but she can't help saying foolish things, as a general
rule
She never was really well brought up
but
it's amazing how good-tempered she is! Pat her on the head, and see how
pleased she'll be
A little kindness -- and putting her hair in papers -- would do wonders
with her
I AM so sleepy
She's tired, poor thing
Smooth her hair -- lend
her your nightcap -- and sing her a soothing lullaby
I haven't got a nightcap with me
and I don't know any soothing lullabies
I must do it myself, then
Hush-a-by lady, in Alice's lap!
   Till the feast's ready, we've time for a nap:
   When the feast's over, we'll go to the ball --
   Red Queen, and White Queen, and Alice, and all!


'And now you know the words
just sing it through to ME. I'm getting sleepy,
too
What AM I to do
I don't think it EVER
happened before, that any one had to take care of two Queens asleep
at once! No, not in all the History of England -- it couldn't, you know,
because there never was more than one Queen at a time. Do wake up, you
heavy things
Visitors' Bell
Servants'
Bell
I'll wait till the song's over
and then I'll
ring -- the -- WHICH bell must I ring
I'm not a visitor, and I'm not a servant. There OUGHT to be
one marked "Queen," you know
No admittance till the week
after next
What is it, now
Where's the
servant whose business it is to answer the door
Which door
THIS door, of course
To answer the door
What's it been asking of
I don't know what you mean
I talks English, doesn't I
Or are you deaf? What
did it ask you
Nothing
I've been knocking at it
Shouldn't do that -- shouldn't do that
Vexes it,
you know
You let IT alone
and it'll let YOU alone, you know
To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said,
   "I've a sceptre in hand, I've a crown on my head;
   Let the Looking-Glass creatures, whatever they be,
   Come and dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me
Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can,
  And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran:
  Put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea --
  And welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three
Thirty times three makes ninety. I wonder if any one's
counting
Tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea
  Along with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me
Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink,
  Or anything else that is pleasant to drink:
  Mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine --
  And welcome Queen Alice with ninety-times-nine
Ninety times nine
Oh, that'll never
be done! I'd better go in at once
I'm glad they've come without waiting to be asked
I
should never have known who were the right people to invite
You've missed the soup and fish
Put on the joint
You look a little shy; let me introduce you to that leg of mutton
Alice -- Mutton; Mutton -- Alice
May I give you a slice
Certainly not
it isn't etiquette
to cut any one you've been introduced to. Remove the joint
I won't be introduced to the pudding, please
or we shall get no dinner at all. May I give you some
Pudding -- Alice;
Alice -- Pudding. Remove the pudding
Waiter! Bring back the
pudding
What impertinence
I wonder how you'd like it, if I
were to cut a slice out of YOU, you creature
Make a remark
it's ridiculous to leave all the
conversation to the pudding
Do you know, I've had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me to-day
and
it's a very curious thing, I think -- every poem was about fishes in some
way. Do you know why they're so fond of fishes, all about here
As to fishes
her White Majesty knows a lovely riddle -- all in
poetry -- all about fishes. Shall she repeat it
Her Red Majesty's very kind to mention it
It
would be SUCH a treat! May I
Please do
First, the fish must be caught."
   That is easy: a baby, I think, could have caught it.
    "Next, the fish must be bought."
   That is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it.

    "Now cook me the fish!"
   That is easy, and will not take more than a minute.
    "Let it lie in a dish!"
   That is easy, because it already is in it.

    "Bring it here! Let me sup!"
   It is easy to set such a dish on the table.
    "Take the dish-cover up!"
   Ah, THAT is so hard that I fear I'm unable!

    For it holds it like glue --
  Holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle:
    Which is easiest to do,
  Un-dish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle
Take a minute to think about it, and then guess
Meanwhile, we'll drink your health -- Queen Alice's health
just like pigs in a trough
You ought to return thanks in a neat speech
We must support you, you know
Thank you very much
but I can do quite well
without
That wouldn't be at all the thing
And they DID push so
You would have thought they wanted to
squeeze me flat
I rise to return thanks
Take care of yourself
Something's going to happen
and
very like birds they look
Here I am
I can't stand this any longer
And as for YOU
As for YOU
I'll shake
you into a kitten, that I will
Your majesty shouldn't purr so loud
You
woke me out of oh! such a nice dream! And you've been along with me,
Kitty -- all through the Looking-Glass world. Did you know it, dear
If they would
only purr for "yes" and mew for "no," or any rule of that sort
so that one could keep up a conversation! But how CAN you talk
with a person if they always say the same thing
no
Now, Kitty
Confess that was what you turned
into
But it wouldn't look at it
it turned away its head, and pretended
not to see it: but it looked a LITTLE ashamed of itself, so I think it
MUST have been the Red Queen
Sit up a little more stiffly, dear
And curtsey while you're thinking what to -- what to purr. It saves time,
remember
just in
honour of having been a Red Queen
Snowdrop, my pet
when WILL
Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder? That must be the
reason you were so untidy in my dream -- Dinah! do you know that you're
scrubbing a White Queen? Really, it's most disrespectful of you!

'And what did DINAH turn to, I wonder
Tell me, Dinah, did you turn to Humpty Dumpty? I
THINK you did -- however, you'd better not mention it to your friends just
yet, for I'm not sure.

'By the way, Kitty, if only you'd been really with me in my dream, there
was one thing you WOULD have enjoyed -- I had such a quantity of poetry
said to me, all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall have a real
treat. All the time you're eating your breakfast, I'll repeat "The
Walrus and the Carpenter" to you; and then you can make believe it's
oysters, dear!

'Now, Kitty, let's consider who it was that dreamed it all. This is a
serious question, my dear, and you should NOT go on licking your paw
like that -- as if Dinah hadn't washed you this morning! You see, Kitty,
it MUST have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my dream,
of course -- but then I was part of his dream, too! WAS it the Red King,
Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know -- Oh, Kitty, DO
help to settle it! I'm sure your paw can wait
